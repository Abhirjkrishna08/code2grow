In this program we have to analyze the performance of multiple students in class
in which it calculates average marks,highest and lowest score,pass/fail and grade according to their marks.

My Approach-
Take the number of students 
Store each student’s marks (out of 100) 
Calculate:
   - Class average  
   - Highest and lowest marks  
   - Number of students who passed and failed 


Concept-
Arrays
loops
conditional statements
Arthmetic operators

SAMPLE INPUT-
Enter total number of students: 6
Enter marks:
95
82
67
49
78
91
SAMPLE OUTPUT-
Average Marks: 77.00
Highest Marks: 95
Lowest Marks: 49
Total Passed Students: 5
Total Failed Students: 1
Grade Distribution:
A+: 2
A : 1
B : 1
C : 1
D : 0
Fail: 1
